# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aolives/Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data/HEAD)

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

- population — the global population
- population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage
- area — the total land and water area

In this guided project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database. If you want to work with this data, you can download the [SQLite factbook.db database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db), it's also included in this repo for your convenience.

More than anything else this project exists to show you that I am familiar with:

- SQL 
- Jupyter Notebooks
